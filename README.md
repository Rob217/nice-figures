# Nice Figures

A collection of scripts, modules, and style files for making publication quality figures in Matplotlib. 

To load module:
```python
from nice_figures load *
```

The following functions are included:
* **load_style()**

   Load a set of predefined rcParams.
   
* **add_numbering()**

   Add numbering (e.g., a, b, c, 1, 2, 3, ...) to axes.

* **load_cols()**

   Load a dictionary of colors.

* **add_border()**

   Add a border around the figure. This is useful in, e.g., Jupyter notebooks, where it is unclear how large the figure.
